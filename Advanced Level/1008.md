1008\. Elevator (20)

The highest building in our city has only one elevator. A request list is made up with N positive numbers. The numbers denote at which floors the elevator will stop, in specified order. It costs 6 seconds to move the elevator up one floor, and 4 seconds to move down one floor. The elevator will stay for 5 seconds at each stop.

For a given request list, you are to compute the total time spent to fulfill the requests on the list. The elevator is on the 0th floor at the beginning and does not have to return to the ground floor when the requests are fulfilled.

**Input Specification:**

Each input file contains one test case. Each case contains a positive integer N, followed by N positive numbers. All the numbers in the input are less than 100.

**Output Specification:**

For each test case, print the total time on a single line.

**Sample Input:**

3 2 3 1

**Sample Output:**

41

**解析**

此题思路简单，对于结果rst来说，初始化为0，每上升n层，rst += 5 + 6 * n, 每下降m层，rst += 5 + 5 * m;

由于一开始就输入了电梯要停留的楼层，所以我们其实可以初始化rst = 5 * N，也即电梯在每一层停留的总时间。

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    int N;
    cin >> N;
    int rst = N*5;
    int preFloor = 0;
    int nextFloor = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        cin >> nextFloor;
        if(nextFloor > preFloor){
            rst += (nextFloor - preFloor) * 6;
            preFloor = nextFloor;
        }
        else{
            rst += (preFloor - nextFloor) * 4;
            preFloor = nextFloor;
        }
    }
    cout << rst << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
